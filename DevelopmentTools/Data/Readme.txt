================================================
   PC development tools for Vircon32 console
  (version 23.10.27). README written by Carra
================================================


What is this?

    This is a set of tools that allow you to create Vircon32
    programs from your PC, by writing C or assembly programs.
    All the programs included here are command-line tools.
    
------------------------------------------------------------

Installing 
    
    These tools are installed following a process similar to
    the one used for installing the emulator (which you will
    probably need as well). The exact steps will depend on
    your operating system.
    
    There is, however, one additional step needed after
    installing: you will need to ensure that the installed
    programs are accessible to the environment by adding the
    installation folder to the corresponding system paths.
    
------------------------------------------------------------

Included programs 
  
  - "compile": a C compiler that allows you to compile your
    C programs for Vircon32 into assembly. It also includes
    the headers for its standard library.
    
  - "assemble": an assembler that allows you to convert your
    assembly programs for Vircon32 into machine code.
  
  - "png2vircon": a program that allows you to convert PNG
    images into the native textures used by Vircon32.
  
  - "wav2vircon": a program that allows you to convert WAV
    sounds into the native sounds used by Vircon32
  
  - "tiled2vircon": a program that allows you to convert
    tilemaps made in the Tiled editor into 2D arrays that
    can be used natively as part of Vircon32 programs.
  
  - "packrom": this program that allows you to pack the
    binaries, images and sound of a same Vircon32 program
    into a single file, that will be executable from any
    Vircon32 emulator or implementation.
    
------------------------------------------------------------

What's new in version 23.10.27?
  
  - Fixed error in directives #error and #warning
  - Added support for extern variables.
  - Allow a final comma in enumerations
  - Allow a final comma in initialization lists
